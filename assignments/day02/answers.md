# Docker Exercise
This assignment is an introduction to Docker and how to create images and containers

## What is Docker?
Docker is a platform to create containers which can be used to host applications in an isolated and recreatable scope

## What is the difference between:
* Virtual Machine
* Docker Container
* Docker Image
A Docker image is basically the recipe for the container while the container is a running instance of the image.
Containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware like virtual machines do.
Containers are more portable and efficient than VM's

## Web API?
A Web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser

## Postgres?
Postgres is an open-source relational database management system

## package.json file dependencies field:
Determines which packages you application will depend on and install when npm install is run

## npm express package:
Express provides small, robust tooling for HTTP servers

## npm pg package:
Pg is a non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js

## What is docker-compose:
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications

## Results
I already knew how to create docker images and containers, but I learned about docker-compose and how to run multiple containers at once.
