            The Jack, Queen and King are worth 10 points
            An Ace is worth 1 or 11 points depending on which is most beneficial to the player

            The player can choose between two actions "21 or under" or "over 21":

            "21 or under" -> The player draws a new card if his total point value:

            Is under 21, the game continues
            Is 21, the player wins the game
            Is over 21, the player loses the game

            "over 21" -> The player draws the final card if his total point value:

            Is under 21, the player loses the game
            Is 21, the player loses the game
            Is over 21, the player wins the game
